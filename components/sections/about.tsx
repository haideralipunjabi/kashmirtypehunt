          Kashmir Type Hunt is a design community based in Kashmir. Our motive
          is to document and archive indigenous type forms. The goal is to build
          awareness about design and type forms around us. What started as
          individuals documenting type has now evolved into a community where
          everyone can submit their find thus documenting and showcasing for all
          the people out there.
